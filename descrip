#converts the password to an integer, multiplies it by a random integer, and calculates the hash value using the fractional part of the password integer raised to the power of 1/3. However, it also includes the math theorem (a + b) % p = ((a % p) + (b % p)) % p, using the random integer as b in the equation. This helps to further obscure the original password and make the hash value more difficult to reverse.
